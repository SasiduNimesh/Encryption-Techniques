# Encryption-Techniques
<h2>Symmetric encryption- Substitution Cipher Techniques</h2><br>
<p>I've designed Python-based project to explore various encryption methods and demonstrate their application in securing data. This project provides a practical hands-on approach to understanding encryption principles, algorithms, and their implementation in Python programming language.</p>
<h3>Encryption Techniques</h3>
<p>1. Shift Cipher<br>
2. Caesar Cipher<br>
3. Rail Fence Cipher<br>
4. Play Fire Cipher<br>
5. Hill Cipher<br>
6. Vernam Cipher
